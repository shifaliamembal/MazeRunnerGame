# Lost in the Lab

## Background Story
You are **Dr. Nova**, a scientist working in a cutting-edge research facility. During an experimental AI system test, an error triggers a self-destruct protocol, sealing you inside a labyrinth of corridors and locked doors. Rogue security drones and traps now threaten your survival. To escape, you must collect override codes (keys) to unlock the exit and navigate the maze of dangers.
